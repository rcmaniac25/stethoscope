#0.1. 3/18/2018:
- Project name determined thanks to a friend

#1.1. 3/19/2018:
- Fleshing out docs and making a main function. Plan for the first couple days is to get the project started, do some parsing, how to get some values from logs, and building habits
- I'm not exactly promoting this with the hashtag right now, just to get this going. I don't feel I need motivation, just less stuff to do. I constantly have ideas and write them down, but lack the time to work on it. It makes me easy to distract, so I want to build a habit naturally with everything else I have going on before I start getting "keep going!" tweets and messages.

#2.1. 3/20/2018:
- Almost missed this day (the commit for yesterday and today say they're a day later, but it's because I start late the prior day). #HabitForming
- Already a bit overthinking it because I started trying to do streaming log parsing... just parse the log right now.
- Initial log format is XML. I'm gonna have to make a config file to determine what properties describe the log, just so the log format isn't hardcoded... but that's for a bit later. Maybe tomorrow?
- Initial plan was for a C++ program... but XML parsing, streaming logs, json parsing too (config and I'm sure someone logs in JSON) are not pleasent to work with in C++ and since I want to get something running instead of dealing with frameworks and C++ package systems, I'm just gonna start with C#

#3.1. 3/21/2018:
- I wanted to try and start processing the actual log data, so I finished the XML parsing part. Should still work on making it stream the input. Noted for later.

#4.1. 3/22/2018:
- Late commit again.
- Plan: initial orginization of log output, get streaming XML working (need option parsing so I can turn this on only if needed), have log values determined by config (requires JSON parsing)
- I started late, so I only go the first one done and will do the others tomorrow

$5.1. 3/23/2018:
- If yesterday was late, this one is later...
- I load a config file of info about parsing logs. As it's very late for me, I will test this tomorrow.
- For the "temp" C# project, I decided to be a little curious and use .Net Portable Framework. I'm kinda regretting it. So many APIs just aren't available. I get it's purpose and it should be used, but going 2 levels deep to open a StreamReader? The main library just opened one internally anyway.
