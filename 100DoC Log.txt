#0.1. 3/18/2018:
- Project name determined thanks to a friend

#1.1. 3/19/2018:
- Fleshing out docs and making a main function. Plan for the first couple days is to get the project started, do some parsing, how to get some values from logs, and building habits
- I'm not exactly promoting this with the hashtag right now, just to get this going. I don't feel I need motivation, just less stuff to do. I constantly have ideas and write them down, but lack the time to work on it. It makes me easy to distract, so I want to build a habit naturally with everything else I have going on before I start getting "keep going!" tweets and messages.
